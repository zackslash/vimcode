## OpenCode Plugin Development

vimcode is a TUI plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Before working on it, understand the plugin system:

**References (read these, don't guess):**
- Official plugin docs: https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/
- V2 plugin types: `@opencode/plugin/tui` exports `Plugin` (`define`, `Definition`, `Cleanup`, `Context`). We do NOT import it at runtime — the host intercepts that specifier, and its type graph pulls in `@opentui/*`/`solid-js` packages that must stay out of `node_modules`. The seam is self-typed in `src/index.ts` with the context as `any`.
- A good reference TUI plugin with slots/keymap/routes: [opencode-workspaces](https://github.com/stephengolub/opencode-workspaces)

**Plugin API surface** (V2, `context: Plugin.Context`):
`options` (plugin options), `storage` (durable `store()` / ephemeral `memory()` → `[Store, mutate]`), `data` (session/forms/permissions + `on`/`listen` events), `keymap` (`layer()` for reactive command layers, `dispatch()`, `mode`), `ui` (toast/dialog/router/panel/tabs/slots), `renderer` (CliRenderer, incl. `currentFocusedEditor`), `theme`, `client`, `app`. `setup()` returns a cleanup function.

**Gotchas we hit during development:**
- TUI plugins go in `tui.json`, not `opencode.json`. The config field is `"plugin"`.
- The plugin `package.json` needs `exports: { "./tui": "./src/index.ts" }` — the loader checks `./tui`, not `.`.
- **`key:before` is NOT a valid intercept type.** The keymap only supports `"key"`, `"key:after"`, and `"raw"`. Passing `"key:before"` silently registers a raw terminal sequence handler that crashes on key events.
- `dispatchCommand()` from inside a `key` intercept doesn't work for cursor movement. Wrap in `setTimeout(..., 0)` to break out of the intercept stack.
- `registerLayer` with `activeWhen` using SolidJS signals requires `reactiveMatcherFromSignal` from `@opentui/keymap/solid`. Plain `() => signal()` doesn't trigger re-evaluation. We chose intercepts instead of layers to avoid this.
- **Leader key is handled entirely within the keymap's `dispatchLayers()`.** There is no separate `useKeyboard` handler for it. `registerTimedLeader` registers a token; `dispatchLayers()` matches it; `getPendingSequence()` exposes the state. Calling `ctx.consume()` in a `key` intercept sets `event.propagationStopped`, which the keymap checks after each intercept — if set, it skips `dispatchLayers()` entirely. In insert mode, printable leaders are consumed and inserted as text; non-printable leaders (ctrl+x, etc.) are not consumed, so they fall through to `dispatchLayers()` and trigger OpenCode's leader bindings.
- **`api.tuiConfig.keybinds`** gives access to OpenCode's resolved keybind config. `api.tuiConfig.keybinds.get("leader")?.[0]?.key` returns the configured leader key. Used by `resolveLeader()` to auto-detect the leader without requiring a separate plugin option.
- **SolidJS/JSX still does not work in cache-installed plugins.** Last reproduced on 2026-09-08 with OpenCode 1.18.21 using an npm-source tarball. A plain `.ts` entry and its TUI hook loaded, but importing a `.tsx` module with `/** @jsxImportSource @opentui/solid */` failed with `Cannot find module '@opentui/solid/jsx-dev-runtime'`. The Solid transform excludes files under `node_modules`; the runtime prescan therefore cannot see the JSX-generated import before Bun resolves it. OpenCode 1.18.25 has identical relevant runtime code and also pins OpenTUI 0.4.5. OpenTUI 0.5.9 retains the exclusion. Until upstream changes this path, avoid JSX and `solid-js` imports in distributed plugins. Use `api.ui.toast()` for mode feedback instead of slot indicators. See [#3](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/3).
- **Do NOT add `solid-js`, `@opentui/solid`, or `@opentui/core` as dependencies or peerDependencies.** If they're in `package.json`, Bun installs them into the plugin's `node_modules/`, and the local `.d.ts` stubs shadow the host's runtime module intercepts. The host provides these at runtime via `ensureRuntimePluginSupport`. Keep them only in `devDependencies` (via `@opencode-ai/plugin` which pulls them in for type-checking).
- **Test distributed plugin behavior through the package cache.** `dev-tui.json` uses `"plugin": ["."]`, which loads from the working tree and does not reproduce cache-only module resolution failures. Use an npm-source tarball spec such as `name@file:/absolute/path/package.tgz` or the real `git+https://...#ref` install form, and clear only that package's cache entry before retesting.

### V2 keymap-layer design (replaces intercepts)

V2 has no raw key intercepts. The plugin registers ONE global keymap layer at priority 10000 in `setup()` — never re-registered. Every key the engine can ever handle (all printable ASCII plus escape/return/tab/backspace/delete/arrows/home/end) gets its own generated command (`vimcode.key.*`); each `run(input, event)` delegates to one shared `handleKey(event)`. A `run` returning `false` continues host dispatch (full pass-through), anything else consumes — this mirrors the V1 `ctx.consume()` semantics exactly. `:q/:wq/:w/:vim` palette + slash commands ride the same layer. All V1 pass-through rules live in `handleKey` in the same order: releases → disabled → overlay (`keymap.mode.current()`, only a positively-identified non-default mode counts) → session prompts (router sessionID + form/permission lists + child-prompt event aggregation) → insert-mode autocomplete dispatch → leader pass-through (normal/visual) → engine handlers → insert-mode printable-leader interception.

V2 specifics to remember:
- **`keymap.layer()` must be called from inside a slot render.** The keymap bridge resolves its provider with Solid `useContext` and throws "Keymap.Provider is missing" when called from `setup()` (outside the component tree). The plugin claims a no-op slot (`append: "app"`, `render` returns `null`) and registers the layer there once, guarded by a flag (slot renders are reactive and can run multiple times — never dispose/recreate). `keymap.dispatch` and `keymap.mode.current` are wrapped in try/catch for the same reason; other surfaces (ui/storage/router/renderer/data) are host services and need no guarding.
- `context.storage.store(name, { initial })` returns `[Store, mutate]`; `mutate((draft) => {...})` is the write path. `src/index.ts` wraps it in a tiny async kv shim so `version.ts` and the disabled flag keep their get/set shape.
- `keymap.dispatch(id)` returns `void` (no `{ ok }`), so insert-mode autocomplete handling dispatches `prompt.autocomplete.*` and falls through instead of conditionally consuming.
- Leader keys come from the global CLI config (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/cli.json` else `~/.config/opencode/cli.json`, `keybinds.leader`), read once at setup; `api.tuiConfig` no longer exists.
- Events: prefer `context.data.listen` (catch-all, matched against `/^(permission|question|form)\./` with `+1` on `*.asked|*.created` and `-1` on `*.replied|*.rejected|*.answered`) over `data.on` — event names are still settling and double-subscription would double-count prompts. Falls back to explicit `data.on` types when `listen` is absent.

### Editor widget API

`api.renderer.currentFocusedEditor` (same object as `currentFocusedRenderable`) exposes the underlying Textarea widget. Not part of the documented plugin API, but stable and available at runtime. The codebase currently uses `plainText`, `cursorOffset`, `visualCursor`, `cursorStyle`, `insertText()`, and `editorView`. The rest of the surface below is available but unused.

**Top-level properties (read/write):**
- `cursorOffset: number` — absolute cursor position, readable and writable
- `visualCursor: { visualRow, visualCol, logicalRow, logicalCol, offset }` — full cursor coordinates (read-only in practice)
- `cursorStyle: { style: "block" | "line" | "underline" | "default", blinking: boolean }` — set directly, no DECSCUSR escape needed
- `plainText: string` — buffer content
- `selectionBg: RGBA`, `selectionFg: RGBA` — custom selection highlight colors

**Top-level methods:**
- `moveCursorLeft/Right/Up/Down()` — direct cursor movement
- `setSelection(start, end)`, `setSelectionInclusive(start, end)`, `clearSelection()` — selection control
- `gotoVisualLineEnd()`, `gotoLineEnd()` — line boundary jumps
- `insertText(text)` — insert at cursor

**editorView methods (lower-level):**
- `setCursorByOffset(n)` — position cursor by offset
- `getNextWordBoundary()`, `getPrevWordBoundary()` — word boundary detection (enables proper `e` vs `w`)
- `getEOL()`, `getVisualSOL()`, `getVisualEOL()` — line boundary info
- `getLineInfo()`, `getLogicalLineInfo()` — line metadata
- `getCursor()`, `getVisualCursor()`, `getText()` — read state
- `getSelectedText()`, `deleteSelectedText()` — selection operations
- `moveUpVisual()`, `moveDownVisual()` — visual line movement
- `setSelection()`, `resetSelection()`, `hasSelection()` — selection management

This API surface makes text objects (`ciw`, `di"`), direct cursor manipulation, and accurate line operations feasible. The current `setTimeout` + `dispatchCommand` approach can be replaced with direct widget manipulation for most operations.

                                    ↓                                                         ↓

```

Handlers in `src/vim/` (`insert.ts`, `normal.ts`, `visual.ts`) are pure — they take state + key + event, mutate state, return actions. They never touch `api`. The only file that calls `api.keymap.dispatchCommand` is `index.ts`. `src/vim/index.ts` is a strict barrel: it re-exports only the public surface (no `export *`, no internal helpers), and sibling modules import each other directly (`./types`, `./state`, …) never through the barrel.

**Action types:**
- `{ type: "cmd", cmd: string }` — dispatched via `setTimeout(() => api.keymap.dispatchCommand(cmd), 0)`
- `{ type: "mode", mode: Mode }` — updates the SolidJS signal for the indicator
- `{ type: "toast", message: string }` — shows a notification
- `{ type: "yank", text: string }` — writes text to system clipboard via `writeClipboard()`
- `{ type: "insertText", text: string }` — inserts text at cursor via `editor.insertText()`
- `{ type: "yankSelection" }` — reads selected text from the focused editor, stores in yank register and clipboard
- `{ type: "clearSelection" }` — clears the textarea's selection via `editorView.resetSelection()`
- `{ type: "cursorTo", offset: number }` — sets `editor.cursorOffset` directly
- `{ type: "selectRange", start: number, end: number }` — calls `editor.setSelectionInclusive(start, end)`
- `{ type: "deleteRange", start: number, end: number }` — deletes text between inclusive offsets via `editBuffer.deleteRange()`. Saves a snapshot for single-step undo (see below).
- `{ type: "undo" }` — if an undo snapshot exists (from a `deleteRange`), restores the full buffer from it. Otherwise falls back to `dispatchCommand("input.undo")`.

### Adding a keybinding

1. In `src/vim/normal.ts`, find the right section in `handleNormalKey()` (motions, operators, special keys, insert entries)
2. Add the key check and return appropriate actions:
   ```ts
   if (key === "yourkey") {
     return { consume: true, actions: [{ type: "cmd", cmd: "input.some.command" }] }
   }
   ```
3. Add a test in the matching `test/vim/*.test.ts` (e.g. `test/vim/normal.test.ts`), importing helpers from `../support` and fixtures from `../fixtures`:
   ```ts
   it("yourkey dispatches some.command", () => {
     const result = handleNormalKey(state, "yourkey", ev("yourkey"), mockPrompt)
     expect(cmds(result.actions)).toEqual(["input.some.command"])
   })
   ```
4. Run `bun test`, then `just dev` to verify in OpenCode.

### Adding an operator+motion combo

Operators (d/c/y) use two tables in `src/vim/tables.ts`: `MOTIONS` maps key → standalone cursor command, `DELETE_MOTION` maps key → destructive command. When an operator is pending and a motion key arrives, `handleNormalKey` (in `src/vim/normal.ts`) looks up `DELETE_MOTION[key]` and dispatches it.

To add a new motion that works with operators:
1. Add the standalone motion to `MOTIONS`: `{ "yourkey": "input.move.whatever" }`
2. Add the destructive version to `DELETE_MOTION`: `{ "yourkey": "input.delete.whatever" }`
3. If the motion needs special handling with operators (like j/k which delete multiple lines), add an explicit branch in the `state.pending.kind === "operator" && key in MOTIONS` section.

### Adding a text object

Text objects (`iw`/`aw`, the quote/bracket pairs, and the `iq`/`ib` aliases) route through one seam, so the handlers never change:

1. Add the pure range algorithm to `src/vim/text.ts` — e.g. `wordRange`, `bracketRange`, `quoteRange`. It takes `(text, offset, around)` (plus the delimiters for pairs) and returns an inclusive `Range` or `null` when there's nothing to select.
2. Add a `case` to `resolveTextObject` in `src/vim/textobject.ts` mapping the object char to that algorithm. This is the only dispatch point — the "any quote" (`q` → `anyQuoteRange`) and "any bracket" (`b` → `anyBracketRange`) aliases compose over the per-delimiter functions, picking the tightest enclosing pair.
3. No handler change needed. `normal.ts` (operator + `i`/`a` → textobject pending → `deleteRange`/`yank`/insert) and `visual.ts` (`i`/`a` → textobject pending → `selectRange`) already send every object char through `resolveTextObject`.
4. Test the range algorithm in `test/vim/text.test.ts` and the dispatch in `test/vim/textobject.test.ts`; add handler branches in `normal.test.ts`/`visual.test.ts` only if the object needs new handling.

### Known limitations

- **`setTimeout` dispatch** — commands are deferred to avoid re-entrancy. Multi-command sequences (like `O` = home + newline + up) rely on ordered setTimeout execution, which works in practice but isn't guaranteed by spec. Many of these can now be replaced with direct widget manipulation (e.g., setting `cursorOffset`, calling `insertText`).
- **editBuffer undo granularity** — the host editor's undo system splits multi-line deletions into per-line entries. Operations that use `deleteRange` (like `dG`, `de`) work around this by saving a pre-operation snapshot and restoring from it on `u`. The snapshot is invalidated when any other buffer-modifying action runs (`cmd` or `insertText`).

## Development

```bash
just dev       # Launch OpenCode with the plugin (uses OPENCODE_TUI_CONFIG=dev-tui.json)
bun test       # Run characterization tests
just check     # Lint + tests (used in GitHub Actions)
```

The `dev-tui.json` config is picked up only by `just dev`. Running `opencode` normally in this directory does not load the plugin.

## Git Workflow

**Never commit, push, or create PRs unless explicitly asked.** Present the changes and wait for the human to decide when to commit.

All changes go through pull requests. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked. CI (`just check`) must pass before merge. PRs are squash-merged — the PR title becomes the commit on `main`.

Branch naming: `type/description` — e.g. `feat/replace-char`, `fix/escape-handling`. Types match commit prefixes (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, `docs`).

## Code Conventions

**Pure functions over side effects.** Handlers return data (actions), callers apply effects. This makes the core logic testable without mocking.

**No classes.** Use plain objects for state (`VimState`), plain functions for behavior. Pass state by reference, mutate it directly. Return results as data.

**Single responsibility per file.** The `src/vim/` engine is split by concern: `types.ts` (data), `text.ts`/`tables.ts` (pure algorithms + keybinding maps), `util.ts`/`state.ts` (state-agnostic primitives + VimState lifecycle), and one handler per mode (`insert.ts`/`normal.ts`/`visual.ts`). `src/index.ts` owns all OpenCode API interaction. `clipboard.ts` owns platform I/O. Don't mix these concerns.

**Barrel firewall + import discipline.** `src/vim/index.ts` re-exports only the public surface (explicit named re-exports, no `export *`, no internal helpers). Sibling modules import each other directly (`./types`, `./state`, `./text`, `./tables`, `./util`) and must never import from the barrel `./index` — barrel-import + barrel-re-export is a circular-import trap that can hand back `undefined` at runtime. Nothing under `src/vim/` may touch the plugin `api`.

**Comments explain why, not what.** The code should read clearly without narration. Reserve comments for non-obvious decisions (like why `setTimeout` is needed for dispatch, or why `g` doesn't wait for a second keypress).

**Test every handler branch.** When you add a keybinding, add a test. The test should verify what actions are returned and how state changes — not what those actions do when applied.

**Prefer discriminated unions.** The `Action` type uses `{ type: "cmd" } | { type: "mode" } | ...` so consumers can exhaustively switch on `action.type`. Add new action types when handlers need new kinds of side effects.

**Every mode transition emits a `mode` action.** The `Mode` type is the single source of truth for all displayable modes — including transient states like `"(insert)"` (one-shot normal). Never represent a mode as a separate boolean flag with a toast side-channel. If something changes what mode the user is in, it goes through the `Mode` type and a `{ type: "mode" }` action.

**Keep each `src/vim/` module focused and under 500 lines.** The engine was split out of a single `vim.ts` once it crossed that line; the handlers already have clear internal sections, so if one grows past 500 again, split it further by concern. The barrel (`index.ts`) stays a pure re-export firewall — never add logic there.

**Shifted key translation** happens in `translateKey()` before the handler sees the key. Handlers work with normalized keys (`$` not `shift+4`, `G` not `shift+g`). Add new shift mappings in `translateKey`, not in handlers.

**TypeScript strictness.** `strict: true` in tsconfig. No `any` in `src/vim/` or `test/`. The `api` parameter in `index.ts` is typed as `any` because the plugin types come from peer deps that may not be installed locally — that's the one acceptable use.

**Cross-platform.** All code must work on macOS, Linux, and Windows. No platform-specific assumptions without a runtime `process.platform` check and fallbacks for other platforms.
