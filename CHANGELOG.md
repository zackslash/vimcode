## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Ported the plugin from the V1 TUI plugin API (`tui(api, options)` + key intercepts) to the V2 API (`setup(context)` + reactive keymap layers) so it loads in OpenCode v2. One global layer at priority 10000 binds every key the engine can handle; each command's `run` delegates to a single handler that returns `false` to pass keys through or consumes them, preserving the V1 intercept semantics (disabled state, overlay passthrough, leader pass-through, one-shot normal, insert-mode printable-leader interception).
- Migrated V1 API calls to their V2 equivalents: `api.kv` → a small async kv shim over `context.storage.store` (durable store `"vimcode"`), `api.ui.toast` → `context.ui.toast.show`, `api.route.current` → `context.ui.router.current`, `api.state.session.*` → `context.data.session.get`/`form.list`/`permission.list`, `api.event.on` → `context.data.listen` catch-all (matching `/^(permission|question|form)\./`, with `data.on` fallback), `api.keymap.dispatchCommand` → `context.keymap.dispatch` (still deferred via `setTimeout`), and `api.lifecycle.onDispose` → a single cleanup function returned from `setup()`.
- Leader keys are now read directly from OpenCode's global CLI config (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/cli.json` or `~/.config/opencode/cli.json`, `keybinds.leader`), since `api.tuiConfig.keybinds` has no V2 equivalent. Resolution failure degrades to no leader pass-through.
- Overlay detection now uses `context.keymap.mode.current()`: only a positively-identified non-default mode is treated as an overlay; `undefined`/unknown values keep vim handling.
- The keymap layer is registered from a no-op `ui.slot` render (`append: "app"`, once, guarded) instead of `setup()`: `keymap.layer()` resolves the keymap provider via Solid `useContext` and throws "Keymap.Provider is missing" outside the app's component tree. `keymap.dispatch` and `keymap.mode.current` are guarded the same way at call time.

### Fixed

- Insert-mode Ctrl+Enter submits again: V2 binds are exact-match, so the two modifier combos the engine consumes (`ctrl+return` → submit, `ctrl+o` → one-shot normal) are now explicitly bound in the generated keymap layer. All other ctrl combos remain unbound and fall through to host bindings.
- Slim plugin dependencies: dropped `@opencode/plugin` from devDependencies and removed the stray `package-lock.json` so package installs stay fast and dependency-free (the host injects its SDK at runtime).
- Permission/question prompts are navigable again: `handleKey` passes keys through whenever the active input mode differs from the baseline captured at layer registration (foreign input modes = an overlay owns the keyboard), and the router session check reads the V2 discriminated union (`route.type === "session"`, with `route.name` as a defensive fallback). Gating is dispatch-time only — v2.0.8 silently drops a command set in which any command carries function-valued `enabled`, and layer-level gating would hide `:q`/`:wq`/`:w`//vim` from the palette because the palette itself pushes a foreign input mode while open.

### Known gaps

- Autocomplete disambiguation is best-effort: V2's `keymap.dispatch` returns `void` instead of `{ ok }`, so in insert mode Escape/Enter always dispatch `prompt.autocomplete.*` and then fall through; the autocomplete layer consumes the key when it is active.
- Motion/delete commands (`input.move.*`, `input.delete.*`, `input.undo`, `app.exit`, `input.submit`) are still dispatched by command ID; if the host renames these they fail silently. The engine was not rewritten to direct editor-widget calls in this port.

## [0.18.1] — 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Updated the documented cache-installed mode indicator limitation with the latest OpenCode and OpenTUI findings ([#3](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/3)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Vim keys remaining unresponsive after dismissing or rejecting a question prompt ([#72](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/72)).

## [0.18.0] — 2026-09-02

### Added

- Word text objects `iw` and `aw`, for use with the `d`, `c`, and `y` operators and in visual mode: `diw`, `ciw`, `daw`, `viw`, and so on ([#57](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/57)).
- Quote and bracket text objects `i"` `i'` `` i` `` `i(` `i{` `i[` `i<` (with `a` variants) for `d`/`c`/`y` and visual mode: `di"`, `ci(`, `vi[`, and so on. `iq`/`ib` match the nearest quote/bracket of any type; `ib` means any bracket, not vim's parens-only `ib`.

### Fixed

- After an operator, `i`/`a` now start a text object instead of switching to insert mode, so `di` and `ci` wait for the object key ([#57](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/57)).

## [0.17.1] — 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Arrow keys no longer get swallowed in normal and visual mode. They pass through to OpenCode, so you can exit the subagent view (and use other native navigation) without first switching to insert mode ([#63](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/63)).

## [0.17.0] — 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Redesigned the vim engine into a modular architecture for easier maintenance and future keybindings. No change to existing keybindings or behavior.

### Fixed

- `dgg` and `drx` no longer leave a stray operator that affected the next keypress.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-08-31

### Added

- `:w` and `:write` now send the prompt instead of autocompleting to `:wq` and quitting OpenCode. Sessions auto-persist, so the natural mapping for vim users' reflexive "save" is to submit the current prompt. `:wq` still quits.

## [0.15.3] — 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Repeated `e` in visual mode now extends the selection progressively instead of getting stuck after the first press.

### Fixed

- `e` in visual mode now moves to end of word instead of behaving like `w` ([#52](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/52)).

## [0.15.1] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Enter/Escape now work on subagent permission dialogs instead of being consumed by vim ([#47](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/47)).

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- Non-printable leader keys (e.g. `ctrl+x`) now work in insert mode instead of being swallowed ([#42](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/42)).
- Escape from insert mode now moves cursor left, matching vim.
- Clipboard now uses `wl-copy` on Wayland instead of `xclip`, which doesn't work there.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added

- `/vim` toggle command to disable/enable vim mode. Persisted across restarts.
- Startup toast when vim is disabled so users know why keybindings aren't active.
- `V` selects the current line and enters visual mode.

### Fixed

- Counted delete/change commands such as `3dw` now undo in one `u` press instead of one undo per repeated host command.
- Leader key now works with modifier-based configurations like the default `ctrl+x`. Previously, `parseLeaderKey` expected vim-style `C-x` notation but OpenCode's keybinds API returns `ctrl+x` format, so the leader key was silently broken for any config with modifiers.
- Leader detection supports all OpenCode modifier aliases (`control`, `alt`, `option`, `super`) and multiple leader bindings.
- Optional chaining on `api.kv.set` to avoid crashes on older OpenCode versions.
- Escape/Enter no longer intercepted when vim is disabled.
- Toggling vim off resets mode and clears pending state.
- `:vim` palette title uses `:` prefix, consistent with `:q`/`:quit`/`:wq`.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Leader key is now auto-detected from OpenCode's `keybinds.leader` config. The `leader` plugin option has been removed.

### Fixed

- Leader key (e.g. space) no longer enters pending-sequence state when typing in question or permission prompt overlays.

## [0.12.2] — 2026-06-08

### Reverted

- Persistent mode indicator removed. The SolidJS slot approach doesn't work from git-installed plugins — the host's JSX runtime can't be resolved from the package cache. Back to toast-only for now ([#3](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/3)).

### Changed

- `modeIndicator` option now accepts `"toast"` (default) or `"none"`. The `"status"` value from v0.12.0 is gone until the host resolves JSX for external plugins.
- `Ctrl+O` one-shot normal now emits a proper `mode` action instead of a toast side-channel. The toast shows `(insert)` in lowercase, matching Vim convention.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- Persistent mode indicator next to the prompt ([#3](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/3)). Shows NORMAL, INSERT, VISUAL, or (insert) for one-shot normal. Replaces the old toast, which disappeared after a second.
- `modeIndicator` option: `"status"` (default, persistent label), `"toast"` (old behavior), or `"none"` (disabled). The old `modeToast` option still works as a fallback.

### Changed

- Plugin entry point is now `.tsx` (was `.ts`) to support SolidJS slot rendering.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- `:q`, `:quit`, and `:wq` quit OpenCode from the command palette ([#19](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/19)). Since `:` already opens the palette, typing `:q` and pressing Enter exits the app.
- `Ctrl+O` in insert mode — run one normal-mode command, then return to insert. Motions, operators, counts, and `r{char}` all work.
- `leader` plugin option — lets you use space (or any key) as leader without breaking insert mode. Spaces type normally while editing, and leader sequences like `space l` still work in normal mode ([#21](https://github.com/oribarilan/vimcode/issues/21)).

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- `dG` and `cG` — delete/change from cursor to end of buffer. `yG` already worked, now all three operators work with `G`.

### Changed

- Cursor shape is set via the editor widget's `cursorStyle` property instead of writing DECSCUSR escape sequences to stdout. Fixes terminals that don't support DECSCUSR (e.g. macOS Terminal.app).

### Fixed

- `dG`, `cG`, `de`, `ce` undo in a single `u` press. The host editor's undo system splits multi-line deletions into per-line entries, so these operations now go through `editBuffer.deleteRange()` with a pre-operation snapshot that `u` restores from directly.
- `yy` reads the cursor position from the editor widget instead of a line counter. The counter drifted on clicks, arrow keys, and word motions, causing `yy` to yank the wrong line.
- `e` moves to end of word instead of behaving like `w`. `de`, `ce`, and `ye` operate on the correct range too.
- `g` waits for a second keypress instead of jumping to buffer start on its own. `gg` now works as a proper two-key command.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- `r{char}` replaces the character under the cursor. Supports counts: `3ra` replaces 3 characters with `a`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- Yank with motions: `yw`, `yb`, `ye`, `y$`, `y0`, `y^`, `yh`, `yl`, `yj`, `yk`, `yG`. Previously only `yy` worked.
- Plugin init sanity test that catches crashes from hostile API shapes before release.
- Biome for linting and formatting, enforced in CI.
- `just test`, `just lint`, `just lint-fix`, `just check` recipes.

### Fixed

- Plugin failed to load when `api.kv` didn't match the expected interface (e.g. object with no `.get` method). Broke installs on some OpenCode versions.

### Changed

- README operators section rewritten to show `d`, `c`, and `y` side by side for each motion.
- Noted that `e` and `w` behave identically (the host has no separate end-of-word command).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- Cross-platform clipboard. Yank/paste now works on macOS (`pbcopy`), Windows (`clip.exe`), and Linux (`xclip`). Previously macOS-only.
- Plugin configuration via `tui.json` tuple syntax. Three options available:
  - `updateCheck` — disable the daily GitHub version check.
  - `modeToast` — disable the mode-switch toast, relying on cursor shape alone.
  - `startMode` — start in normal mode instead of insert.
- Daily caching for the update checker via `api.kv`. Previously checked GitHub on every launch.
- GitHub Actions CI — runs `bun test` on push and PR to main.
- Issue templates for bug reports and missing keybinding requests.
- Version sync test — catches drift between `VERSION` and `package.json` at test time.
- `typecheck` script (`tsc --noEmit`) in `package.json`.
- MIT LICENSE file.

### Changed

- Removed unused devDependencies (`@opentui/core`, `@opentui/keymap`, `@opentui/solid`, `solid-js`). Pinned `@opencode-ai/plugin` to `^1.15.4`.
- Removed `private: true` from `package.json`.
- Dropped lockfiles from git. Plugin consumers resolve their own deps.
- Replaced local paths in AGENTS.md with public GitHub URLs.
- Fixed `g`/`gg` contradiction in README — `g` removed from keybinding tables.
- Added platform notes and configuration sections to README.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-25

### Changed

- Updated AGENTS.md with current line counts and visual mode status in known limitations.

### Removed

- Dead `readClipboard()` export from clipboard module.
- Stale implementation plan (`docs/plan.md`) from initial prototype.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- Character-wise visual mode (`v`). Select text with motions, then `d`/`x` to delete, `c` to change, `y` to yank. All normal-mode motions work for extending the selection, with counts.
- Tab inserts a tab character in insert mode. Previously fell through to OpenCode's default handler because the plugin had no way to insert text at the cursor. Now uses `insertText` on the focused editor directly.

### Fixed

- `j`/`k` now move the cursor up/down in multi-line text. Previously they always dispatched prompt history commands because the plugin read prompt text from `api.prompt` which doesn't exist. Now reads from `api.renderer.currentFocusedEditor.plainText`.
- `d` in visual mode deletes the full selection instead of just the last character. The `clearSelection` action was racing the deferred `input.backspace` command.
- Block cursor now shows in visual mode (not just normal mode).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-24

### Removed

- Tab insertion in insert mode. The clipboard-based workaround (write tab to clipboard, paste, restore) clobbered the user's clipboard and raced with async I/O. Tab now falls through to OpenCode's default handler.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- `/` in normal mode opens the session timeline (jump-to-message picker).
- `[`/`]` scroll the conversation view half a page up/down.
- `{`/`}` jump to the previous/next message in the conversation.
- `translateKey` now maps shift+`[` → `{` and shift+`]` → `}`.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Update check now uses GitHub API instead of raw.githubusercontent.com, which caches content for up to 5 minutes.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-21

_No user-facing changes. Version bump to test the update notification._

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- Update check on launch. Shows a toast when a newer version is available on GitHub.

### Changed

- Install instructions now pin a version tag (`#v0.3.1`). Changing the tag in `tui.json` invalidates the cache and pulls the new version on next launch.

### Fixed

- Cursor shape now works for git-installed plugins, not just `just dev`. Switched from `addPostProcessFn` (unavailable in the cache context) to a direct DECSCUSR interval.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- Cursor shape changes with mode: block in normal mode, bar in insert mode. Uses DECSCUSR escape sequences via a post-render hook, bypassing the Textarea's hardcoded block cursor.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Vimcode now passes through all keys when any overlay is active (command palette, session list, question prompts, permission prompts). Previously vim consumed j/k/Enter/Escape before these UIs could handle them.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Vim keybindings no longer interfere with the question tool. When the AI asks a question with selectable options, vimcode passes through all keys.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- `Ctrl+Enter` submits the prompt from insert mode. Previously there was no way to submit without switching to normal first.
- `j`/`k` in normal mode cycle through prompt history when the input is empty, matching up/down arrow behavior.

### Fixed

- File picker and autocomplete work in insert mode. Enter picks the selected item and Escape closes the picker without leaving insert. Previously the vim intercept consumed both keys before the autocomplete layer saw them.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- Colored mode indicator in the prompt bar when running from source (`just dev`). Falls back to toast for git/npm installs where the host runtime modules can't be imported.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Git URL installation works. Removed all external runtime imports (`solid-js`, `@opentui/solid`) since OpenCode's runtime module plugin doesn't resolve host packages for cache-installed plugins.

### Changed

- Mode indicator replaced with toast notifications. Toast shows "NORMAL" or "INSERT" briefly on each switch.

### Removed

- `indicator.ts` (no longer needed without the slot-based indicator).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Git URL installation works. Replaced JSX with programmatic rendering to avoid `jsx-dev-runtime` resolution failure from the package cache path.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Git URL installation (`vimcode@git+https://...` in `tui.json`) no longer fails with `jsxDEV not found`. Peer deps moved to devDependencies so type stubs don't shadow the host runtime.

### Changed

- Removed unnecessary `"."` export from package.json. Only `"./tui"` is needed by the plugin loader.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-18

First release. Modal editing for the OpenCode prompt.

### Added

- Normal and insert modes, toggled by `Escape` and insert-entry keys.
- Mode indicator in the prompt bar (NORMAL/INSERT).
- Normal mode motions: `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `w`, `b`, `e`, `0`, `^`, `$`, `g`, `G`.
- Numeric counts for all motions (`3j`, `5w`, etc.).
- Operators `d` (delete), `c` (change), `y` (yank) with motion combinations (`dw`, `c$`, `yb`).
- Doubled operators for line-wise action: `dd`, `cc`, `yy`.
- Counts on both operator and motion (`2d3w`).
- `D` and `C` shortcuts for delete/change to end of line.
- Insert entries: `i`, `a`, `A`, `o`, `O`.
- `x`, `X`, `u`, `Ctrl+r`, `p`, `J`, `:`, `Enter`.
- Insert mode `Enter` inserts a newline.
- Yank copies to system clipboard via `pbcopy`.

> `g` fires immediately as buffer-home instead of waiting for `gg`. The `yy` line tracker drifts on clicks and arrow keys. Visual mode and text objects aren't feasible without cursor position access.
